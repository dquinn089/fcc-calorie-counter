## Overview

This project is a calorie counter application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to set a daily calorie budget, add food and exercise entries, and calculate the remaining calories based on the input. The interface is simple and user-friendly, designed to help users easily track their daily caloric intake and expenditure.

## My process

I started by building the HTML structure, ensuring semantic markup and clear organization of elements. I then styled the application using CSS, focusing on a clean and responsive design. The JavaScript functionality was implemented last, handling the addition of food and exercise entries, calculation of remaining calories, and dynamic updates to the UI.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Through this project, I deepened my understanding of manipulating the DOM with JavaScript and handling user inputs dynamically. I also learned how to implement validation for numeric inputs and ensure the application handles different types of user interactions smoothly.

### Continued development

I plan to further enhance this project by adding features such as a database for persistent storage of entries, integration with external APIs for more detailed nutritional information, and improved validation and error handling. Additionally, I aim to explore more advanced CSS techniques and JavaScript frameworks to enhance the functionality and design.
